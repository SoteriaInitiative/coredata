# About the Project
The Core Data standard is part of the [Soteria Initiative](https://soteria-initiative.org/) to establish common financial
crime data standards and includes the customer and entity data elements, collectively 
party data records, as well as transaction record standards.

Such standards are vital for financial crime professionals and systems alike.
The standards allow financial crime professionals to express criminal activity patterns
using concrete data examples. Systems such as cross-entity federated learning algorithms
need the standards so that they can rely on homogeneous input data for training and inference.

The standards are a minimum set of data elements for the objective but build on
existing more comprehensive definitions such as:
- [Financial Market Standard Body Customer Onboarding Standard](https://fmsb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241217_Standard-for-COB_FINAL.pdf)
- [SWIFT ISO 20022 Messaging Standard](https://www2.swift.com/knowledgecentre/publications/iso_20022_fnc_instit_get_st/4.0?topic=technical-implementation.htm) (free account required)

To make the standards useful synthetic data generators will be provided and a reference
implementation of a data editor will allow the encoding of actual financial crime patterns.

# Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/SoteriaInitiative/coredata.git
cd coredata
```
2. Install the required dependencies
```zsh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Provide application configuration and create a service account on GCP and add a JSON key with edit permissions.
4. Set the Google Cloud parameters
5. Run synthetic data generator and review results
```zsh
python generator.py
```

    <summary>ðŸ’¡Hint how to read the data:</summary>

Observe that each bank detections only a small set of transactiosn (red) but the vast majority
of illicit transactions is not detected (yellow) because these are not part of the local knowledge/scenario pool.
