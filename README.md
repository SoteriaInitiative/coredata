# About the Project
The Core Data standard is part of the [Soteria Initiative](https://soteria-initiative.org/) to establish common financial
crime data standards and includes the customer and entity data elements, collectively 
party data records, as well as transaction record standards. For a technical overview consult the [technical documentation](https://deepwiki.com/SoteriaInitiative/coredata) - auto generation courtesy of DeepWiki.

As per the current release 95% of core standards are covered exemplified below:

| Region        | Network / System       | Standard / Format           | Coverage | 
|---------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Europe**    | SEPA (EU)               | ISO 20022 (`pain.001`, `pacs.008`) | ✅ ~95%                     | 
| **Global**    | SWIFT (MT/MX)           | MT103 / ISO 20022 (`pacs.009`) | ✅ ~95%                  | 

Such standards are vital for financial crime professionals and systems alike.
The standards allow financial crime professionals to express criminal activity patterns
using concrete data examples. Systems such as cross-entity federated learning algorithms
need the standards so that they can rely on homogeneous input data for training and inference.

The standards are a minimum set of data elements for the objective but build on
existing more comprehensive definitions such as:
- [Financial Market Standard Body Customer Onboarding Standard](https://fmsb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241217_Standard-for-COB_FINAL.pdf)
- [SWIFT ISO 20022 Messaging Standard](https://www2.swift.com/knowledgecentre/products/Standards%20MX/publications?protected=true&reload-date=1743955486276) (free account required)

To make the standards useful synthetic data generators is provided and a reference
implementation of a data editor will allow the encoding of actual financial crime patterns.

# 🕹 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/SoteriaInitiative/coredata.git
cd coredata
```
2. Install the required dependencies
```zsh
brew install python
brew install --cask google-cloud-sdk
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
```
<details>
    <summary>💡Hint if you don't have 'brew':</summary>

If you do not have the ``brew`` tool installed, open a terminal
window and type: 
```zsh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

If you are using an Intel Mac computer type the following after the installation:
```zsh
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bashrc
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

If you are using an Apple Silicon (M1, M2, etc.) computer type the following after the installation:
```zsh
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

You can verify the installation by typing:
```zsh
brew doctor
```

If terminal prints ``Your system is ready to brew`` everything worked OK.

3. Provide application configuration and create a service account on GCP.  The
query tool reads credentials directly from environment variables, so no JSON key
file is required.  Set the following variables in your shell:
```zsh
export GCS_BUCKET_NAME=soteria-core-data
export GCP_PROJECT_ID=<PROJECT_ID>
export GCP_PRIVATE_KEY_ID=<KEY_ID>
export GCP_PRIVATE_KEY="<BASE64_OR_MULTILINE_PRIVATE_KEY>"
export GCP_CLIENT_EMAIL=<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>
export GCP_CLIENT_ID=<CLIENT_ID>
```

4. Set the Google Cloud parameters
```zsh
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>
```
Now create the storage bucket and replace `us-central1` with your desired location:
```zsh
gcloud storage buckets create gs://soteria-core-data \
    --location=us-central1 \
    --default-storage-class=STANDARD

```
5. Run synthetic data generator:
```zsh
python implementation/generator.py
```
To review the raw data for ``Bank_1`` on a terminal run:
```zsh
gsutil cp gs://soteria-core-data/Bank_1_transactions.json .
cat Bank_1_transactions.json | jq . | more
```

6. Explore the data with the query tool (results are shown in tables with record counts):
```zsh
python tools/goaml_query.py receivers
python tools/goaml_query.py labels --scope both
python tools/goaml_query.py transactions "Jessica" "Hale" "1948-11-07T00:00:00" --bank "CH National"
python tools/goaml_query.py multi-bank
```
The tool resolves party names from ``involved_parties`` sections so that
senders and receivers are identified even when transactions only reference
accounts. The ``transactions`` command reports both incoming and outgoing
payments for the given party and displays transaction amount, account balance
amount, running balance, and the local and global label flags for each record.
The ``senders`` and ``receivers`` commands additionally show counts of incoming
and outgoing transactions for each party, plus an ``Accounts`` column indicating
how many distinct bank accounts are associated with each party. The ``multi-bank``
command lists parties that hold accounts at more than one bank.
<details>
    <summary>💡Hint how to interpret the data:</summary>

Observe that each bank detects only a small set of transaction 
(local_label is 1 but global is 1) but the vast majority
of illicit transactions is not detected (local_label is 0 but global is 1) 
because these are not part of the local knowledge/scenario pool.
